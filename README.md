You need the `1Password10.sqlite` (check the filename expected in `pwCrack.py`) in the same directory as this program.
You also need a plain file names `passwords` containing a list of all possible password.

You also need to install the appropriate dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can then run `python bruteForcePW.py`
